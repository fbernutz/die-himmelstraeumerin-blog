# Hi! I'm Feli ðŸ‘‹

I'm iOS developer from Nuremberg, Germany.

My focus is building apps with **user experience and accessibility** in mind. In my free time, I enjoy being outside for climbing, running, and other kinds of sports. No motivation for any side projects at the moment.

Potentially interested in speaking at conferences about:
- accessibility
- design systems

Also available for sketchnoting workshops at conferences.
