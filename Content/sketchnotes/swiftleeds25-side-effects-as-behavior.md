## Detailed image description of the sketchnote

- Side Effects as Behavior or what plastic surgery and coding have in common
- Logging propagation pain
- Capture context with structure
- Post-it’s don’t make a diary -> Logging needs own architecture, separate to UI + business logic
- Swift Actors: testable, centralized, shared state, concurrency for ownership
- Idea: actors as side effect managers
