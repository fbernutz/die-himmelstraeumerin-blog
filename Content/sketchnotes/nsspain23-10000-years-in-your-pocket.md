## Detailed image description of the sketchnote

- everyone has a phone in their pocket
- high expectations lead to emotions like anger
- Developers get cranky: why dont we have this? why is it not working?
- Think differently!
- You can unlock it with your face!
- Celebrate and use with joy

### Date
- Gregorian Calendar since 1582 in Italy, Spain and Portugal
- only 170 years later adapted by England
- Greece even ~300 years later
- Date changed from Feb 11, 1732 to Feb 22, 1732
- imagine all the meetings & differences all these years

### Aluminium
- was once worth a lot!
