## Detailed image description of the sketchnote

- Automate all the things, Xcode Source Editor Extension
- Swift + Extension + Internet

### Let's talk, Xcode!

AI tools are not the savior of humanity!

### What AI is NOT:

- Super smart
- Magical solution
- Perfect solution

But it is a tool!

### Use cases

- generate struct from JSON
- generate JSON from Struct (mocking Backend)
- add code documentation

- Safe time for repetitive tasks
- Don't send user data or company private code
- Review Results of Prompts
- AI is not a replacement for human creativity
