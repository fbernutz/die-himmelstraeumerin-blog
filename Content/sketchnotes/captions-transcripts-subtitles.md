Sketchnote with the title: Captions, Transcripts, Audio Descriptions, Sign Language Interpretation??? 

What they have in common is that all of them are alternative ways to access audio and video content.

1. Captions (most widely used) 

* written text synchronized with content
* same language as main audio track
* include important non-speech information
* benefit people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have cognitive disability, but everyone else too

There are two variants, closed captions and open captions.

Closed Captions (CC):

* text on top of video
* can be turned on or off
* sometimes styling can be changed

Open Captions (OC):

* text burnt into video
* can’t be turned off or styled

Captions are not subtitles. Subtitles are visual text for people who can hear audio, e.g. watching a foreign language film. But there are geographical differences.

2. Transcripts

* similar to captions
* create transcripts from captions and add more details
* search bots can crawl transcripts
* useful for people with cognitive disabilities or for people who want to review the content at their own speed
* different presentation possible, often links to external pages

3. Audio Description

* use a narrator to explain visual information
* for people who are blind, have low vision or cognitive disorders
* include nonverbal information like facial expression, unspoken actions etc
* very detailed
* video will pause to give narrator enough time

4. Sign Language Interpreter

* interpreter narrates the audio-only using sign language
* richer experience than captions or transcripts, more expressive and detailed
* important for people who are deaf, with sign language as first and most fluent language
* time-consuming and cost-prohibitive to many organizations
* over 300 different sign languages worldwide
