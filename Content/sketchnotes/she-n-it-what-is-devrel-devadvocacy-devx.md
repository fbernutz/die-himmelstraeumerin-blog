description: Sketchnote about an introduction to what Developer Advocacy is. It consists  of various aspects, like Developer Education, Developer Marketing, Developer Experience, Developer Success and the community. Developer Advocacy is about tech skills, soft skills, creativity, writing, relationships and connections. You should have fun with sharing knowledge, being social, curiosity, helping others and showing initiative. But there is no clear path into it. Just be public and passionate about what you're doing.
