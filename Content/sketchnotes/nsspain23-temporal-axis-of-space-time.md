## Detailed image description of the sketchnote

### Parallel Concepts

- Coordinates and Meridians
- Spatial vs temporal
- Both use raw numbers
- Calendars are maps of time
- Humans are messy...
- Everything is arbitrary!
- Trust the map!
- Things on a map have an "address"
- Specific names may not exist, even though they look right
- Names are well-intentoned and ultimatively meaningless
- Cardinal = Name
- Ordinal = Offset
- Offsetting is generally safe
