"This talk was difficult."

Workplace trauma is real. Your feelings are valid. You are not alone. This work is too important to loose more people. Accessibility as a field is stretched too thin and it's leading to burnout.

### Pipeline to Burnout

Burnout factors disproportionately affect accessibility specialists!

1.	Lack of control
2.	sense of hopelessness
3.	unclear and changing job expectations
4.	unreasonable workload
5.	having to fight for a seat at the table

Advocacy work is mentally draining. Burnout is a failure of management. No one should fear taking time off. We genuinely care about the work.

### Prevention

All hope isn’t lost. It’s not the actual work but the environment that we are forced to do the work in…

#### Community

* be transparent
* find accessibility group for support
* check in with your team
* raise awareness about difficulties

#### Office

* compromise – You can't do everything
* re-evaluate your relationship with work
* take mental health days & medical leave
* talk openly
* use boundary statements
