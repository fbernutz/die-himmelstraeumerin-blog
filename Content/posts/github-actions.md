# Migration from Travis CI to GitHub Actions

The last days, I migrated some of my open source repositories from [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

I only used Travis for running tests or linter, nothing too complicated.

## Running Tests in iOS Repositories

Most of my `.travis.yml` files looked similar to the code snippet below. I want to run two commands in the CI (with fastlane):

- `bundle exec fastlane test`
- `bundle exec fastlane snapshot_test`

```
language: swift
osx_image: xcode11.2
cache:
  - bundler
install:
  - bundle install
  - pod install --repo-update

jobs:
  include:
    - script: bundle exec fastlane test
      name: Unit Tests
    - script: bundle exec fastlane snapshot_test
      name: Snapshot Tests
```

The first lines are setup code, like specifying the Xcode version or which dependencies have to be installed.

### How to migrate to GitHub Actions?

There are two steps for this:

1. Add Workflow
2. Delete `.travis.yml`

#### 1. Add Workflow

To migrate this to GitHub Actions, I started with tapping on the "Actions" tap in the repository.

<img src="../../images/github-actions/github-actions-tab.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the tabs in a repository of GitHub, where 'Actions' is highlighted." />

It will create a new file for you `.github/workflows/<name>.yml` with a editor. On the left there is a preview of the most important documentations to understand the syntax and a link to featured marketplace actions.

<img src="../../images/github-actions/github-actions-editor.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub Actions editor." />

This editor is helpful (sometimes), because it checks for valid syntax, but it can also be a pain. When you want to add a new line between existing code there are some autocompletion actions and it adds some syntax for you. Iâ€™m always suprised when this happens.

The following code snippet shows what you have to define when you want to have the same functionality from the Travis setup.

```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  unit_tests:
    name: Unit Tests
    runs-on: macOS-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: Install Gem Dependencies
      run: bundle install
        
    - name: Install CocoaPods Dependencies
      run: pod install --repo-update

    - name: Run UnitTests
      run: bundle exec fastlane test

  snapshot_tests:
    name: Snapshot Tests
    runs-on: macOS-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: Install Gem Dependencies
      run: bundle install

    - name: Install CocoaPods Dependencies
      run: pod install --repo-update

    - name: Run SnapshotTests
      run: bundle exec fastlane snapshot_test
```

Sadly there is nothing like a `install` phase (yet?), which I know from Travis or Gitlab CI. So, there is some duplicated code in here for installing the dependencies for each job. But there is a solution for it. You can create a "Install Dependency" job and the other jobs then wait for this to finish but I didnâ€™t try it out yet. I found this in the [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/the-same-dependency-in-all-workflows-jobs/td-p/37266) where I discovered some useful hints and tips.

#### 2. Delete `.travis.yml`

And when you have added the jobs in the new file, you can delete your `.travis.yml` file and you are already finished. I highly recommend to try this out in a branch ðŸ˜‰

### Benefits from GitHub Actions

#### All jobs are visible

When you add a new pull request for the migration, youâ€™ll see, that all jobs are directly displayed in the pull request.

<img src="../../images/github-actions/checks.jpg" alt="Two screenshots, one where you can only see one check (from Travis CI) and one where you can see three checks which ran with GitHub Actions." /> 

#### Speed

When using Travis CI, the jobs had to be in queue for some time before they started, like 5 to 10 minutes. This seems to happen instantly with GitHub Actions, I didnâ€™t wait for 30 seconds to see that the jobs have already started. So, instead of waiting ~12 minutes for all jobs to finish with Travis CI, I now wait ~4 minutes. This is such a huge difference!

#### Marketplace

There is a ton of community work available to use. You can browse through the [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) and you can imagine to automate everything, you could ever think of. Maybe Iâ€™m exaggerating, but this was my first impression.

There is a repository called "[Awesome Actions](https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions)" where some (obviously) awesome actions are collected.

#### MacStadium

When running jobs with `macos-latest`, GitHub uses [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/) to host the macOS runners as stated in their [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners). This also saves some time when there is no waiting time for starting virtual machines.

## Additions

### Run CI from forks

When you use the "Actions" tab to create a new workflow the default for the trigger is `on: [push]`. I thought, this is perfect for my use cases, but when someone forked the repository and creates a pull request, no CI is running automatically. So, I used `on: [push, pull_request]` as trigger, but then the jobs are running twice when creating a pull request. The solution is this:

```
on:
push:
  branches:
  - master
pull_request:
  branches:
  - master
```

Found in the [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/How-to-trigger-an-action-on-push-or-pull-request-but-not-both/td-p/35805)

### Pin Xcode Version

Itâ€™s also possible to pin the Xcode version. Add the following code above `jobs`.

```
env:
  DEVELOPER_DIR: /Applications/Xcode_11.3.app/Contents/Developer
```

Found in the [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Selecting-an-Xcode-version/m-p/32340#M1092)

### Pin macOS version

Currently, itâ€™s only possible to use the `macos_latest` tag to specify that you need a Mac to run your jobs. The tag currently specifies to use `macOS 10.15`. When you have to use another macOS version, itâ€™s not possible to specify an explicit version. But maybe the solution for this is to use [self-hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-self-hosted-runners) which sounds interesting, but also a bit overhead for these simple tasks which I need the CI for.
