# MiXiT 2023: My First Conference as a Speaker

Last week, I gave my very first external [conference talk at MiXiT conference](https://mixitconf.org/2023/why-is-being-different-actually-a-good-thing-my-way-into-tech) in Lyon, France! Yay! ðŸ¥³

Besides being quite nervous obviously, I had a great experience on stage! I think... Because I donâ€™t really remember anything except going on stage and leaving the stage again ðŸ˜…

At the conference, I had some initial hesitance to approach other people, because Iâ€™m very introverted and everyone spoke in French and I didnâ€™t want to force anyone to speak English with me. But I met some of the nicest people who saw me standing around by myself and who decided to talk to me and include me in their group ðŸ§¡ I did not expect something like this!

In general, I was very impressed with the inclusivity of the event. It was amazing to meet new people outside of my iOS developer bubble and I really enjoyed the events that were organized for the speakers, which helped me a lot to connect with others. Sadly there were only a few other talks in English, the rest were given in French. But from talking to other speakers, I heard that there were a lot of interesting talks about more inclusion in workplaces and about accessibility. Maybe thereâ€™s a chance to watch the recordings with English transcripts ðŸ¤ž

Lyon alone is worth the trip. I really enjoyed walking around and exploring the city. There are some beautiful areas with fascinating views! After the conference, we had the opportunity to join a two-hour city tour to learn more about the history of Lyon.

Thank you to all MiXiT organizers and participants for making this a lovely experience!

Job as iOS Developer. Am I at the right place? Donâ€™t change to fit in! Inclusion is having a voice. Tips for inclusive environment: 1. Introduce yourself with your pronouns. 2. Make everyoneâ€™s voice heard. 3. Donâ€™t act surprised when someone doesnâ€™t know what you say, use it as opportunity. Embrace diversity: give feedback, talk about income, developer job is diverse, fight imposter syndrome, find community" />
